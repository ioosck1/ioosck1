### **Tree Calculate Expression** (Java) [Download Project Files](project/Treecalexp.java)  
A command-line program that **transforms mathematical expressions** into a format that is easy to understand and calculates the result based on the given input. Users can input expressions in **prefix**, **infix**, or **postfix** notation.

#### **How It Works**:
1. **Prefix Notation**:  
   - Example: `+ - 2 3 * 3 4`  
2. **Infix Notation**:  
   - Example: `( ( 1 + 2 ) + ( 2 / 3 ) )`  
3. **Postfix Notation**:  
   - Example: `2 3 + 4 *`  

The program parses the input expression and outputs the final result as a standard mathematical equation along with the calculated value.

### **Game Rental Store** (C++) [Download Project Files](project/game%20rental%20store.cpp)  
A command-line program that simulates a **game rental service**. Users can interact with the program by answering questions in a **step-by-step format**, and the program provides a summary and generates a **receipt in a .txt file** if the user requests it.

#### **How It Works**:
1. The user is asked how many games they want to rent (up to 5).  
2. The user specifies the rental duration (in days).  
3. The user is asked how many people will split the rental cost.  
4. The user selects the games they want to rent by entering the corresponding number for each game.  
5. The program calculates the total cost and displays a summary of the rental details.  
6. The user is asked whether they want a receipt:  
   - **If Yes**: The program generates a `.txt` file with all rental details.  
   - **If No**: The program ends without generating a receipt.

This structured flow ensures that users interact with the program in a logical order, making it easy to follow.

### **Puzzle Game** (Java) [Download Project Files](project/Puzzle%20game)  
A **number puzzle game** where players must arrange numbers in ascending order by sliding tiles on a 4x4 grid. The game starts with a randomized board and includes a timer to track progress.

#### **Features**:
- **Start Button**: Randomizes the puzzle layout and starts a 5-minute timer.  
- **Submit Button**: Checks if the puzzle is correctly solved.  
- **Exit Button**: Allows the player to exit the game with a confirmation prompt.

‚ùó **Limitation**: The timer cannot be paused or adjusted mid-game.

### **Food Shop Program** (Python) [Download Project Files](project/Food_Shop3.py)   
A command-line application that simulates a **food ordering system**. Users can browse menus, add items to their cart, and apply promotions. The program also includes interactive features such as confirming orders and removing items from the cart.

#### **Main Menu Options**:
1. **Food and Drinks Menu**:  
   - Users can choose from different categories such as food or drinks.  
   - Once inside, users can select items by typing the corresponding number.

2. **Cart**:  
   - Displays the selected items, their quantities, and the total price.  
   - Automatically applies any available promotions to the cart.  
   - Users have the following sub-options:  
     - **Confirm Order**: Finalizes the order and shows the total cost.  
     - **Remove Item**: Allows users to remove items from the cart by typing the exact item name. If an item is selected multiple times, users must type the name multiple times to remove each instance.  
     - **Check Promotions**: Displays any applicable promotions.

3. **Promotions Details**:  
   - Lists available promotions and explains how they apply to specific items.

4. **Exit Program**:  
   - Ends the program with a confirmation prompt.

#### **How to Input Commands**:
- To select multiple options at once, type the numbers or commands separated by a **single space**.  
  Example:  
  ```
  1 2 3 4
  ```

‚ùó **Limitation**:  
- Some price calculations may be incorrect due to unhandled edge cases in the promotion logic.
