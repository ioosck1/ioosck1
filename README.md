These are projects I have completed as part of coursework, with the final submission to the instructor. No further revisions were made after submission.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Alco-Free Helper Chatbot** (Python)  
A chatbot developed using **Python** on **Google Colab** to promote healthy lifestyle choices by recommending non-alcoholic drinks. The chatbot was trained using a machine learning model with **6 predefined classes**, each class corresponding to a different type of response.  

#### **Features**:
- Utilizes **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** to understand user queries.  
- Responds with predefined answers based on the detected class.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Tree Calculate Expression** (Java)  
A command-line program that evaluates mathematical expressions using **binary expression trees**. The program allows users to input expressions in **prefix**, **infix**, or **postfix** notations and calculates the result accordingly.  

#### **How It Works**:
1. The user selects the notation type:  
   - **Prefix** (e.g., `+ - 2 3 * 3 4`)  
   - **Infix** (e.g., `( ( 1 + 2 ) + ( 2 / 3 ) )`)  
   - **Postfix** (e.g., `2 3 + 4 *`)  
2. The user enters the expression.  
3. The program parses the expression, builds a binary tree, and calculates the result.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Game Rental Store** (C++)  
A command-line program that simulates a **game rental store system**. Users can rent games, specify rental durations, and split costs among friends. The program generates a **summary receipt** as a `.txt` file.  

#### **How It Works**:
1. The user specifies how many games to rent (up to 5).  
2. The user specifies the rental duration (in days).  
3. The user specifies how many people will split the rental cost.  
4. The program calculates the total cost and displays a breakdown.  
5. The user can choose to save the receipt as a `.txt` file.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Puzzle Game** (Java)  
A simple **number puzzle game** where players must arrange numbers in ascending order by sliding tiles on a 4x4 grid. The game includes a timer and submission feature to check if the puzzle is correctly solved.  

#### **Features**:
- **Start Button**: Randomizes the puzzle layout and starts a 5-minute timer.  
- **Submit Button**: Checks if the puzzle is correctly solved.  
- **Exit Button**: Allows the player to exit the game with a confirmation prompt.  

‚ùó **Limitation**:  
- The timer cannot be paused or adjusted mid-game.

   - Displays selected items, total price, and applicable promotions.  
   - Users can remove items or confirm their orders.  
3. **Promotion Details**:  
   - Displays ongoing promotions.  
4. **Exit Option**:  
   - Allows users to exit the program with a confirmation prompt.  

‚ùó **Limitation**:
